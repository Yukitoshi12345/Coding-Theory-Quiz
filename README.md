# Coding Theory Quiz
To test our newly developed JavaScript skills and preparation for future coding challenges, I built an interactive, browser-based quiz application. This timed masterpiece, filled with multiple choice questions and sporting a dynamic, responsive UI, required us to code everything from scratch, HTML and CSS included, showcasing the power of pure JavaScript!

## User Story

```

## Objectives
